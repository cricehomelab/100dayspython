How this works.
1.  Start the gameplay loop.
2.  Ask the player if they want rock paper or scissors. capture in a variable
3.  Have the computer pick randomly.
4.  Display the choices.
5.  Compare the player and computer's choice, and declare a winner.
6.  Program goes back to the start of the while loop.

20211219 - Adding a while loop so the game can be played more times than once. I had to change the way my if else
           worked here so it would not end with an error if we quit the game.
