'''
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code below ğŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡


remaining_months = (90 * 12) - (int(age) * 12)
remaining_weeks = (90 * 52) - (int(age) * 52)
remaining_days = (90 * 365) - (int(age) * 365)

print(f"You have {remaining_days} days, {remaining_weeks} weeks, and {remaining_months} months left.")
