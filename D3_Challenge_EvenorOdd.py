This is a challenge to see if we can detect an even or an odd number. In this challenge we are prompted to use the
modulo or (%) symbol to evaluate the number. The modulo detects the remainder of a number.

If we divide an even number by 2 it will have a remainder of 0
IE 10/2 = 5
If we divide an odd number by 2 it will have a remainder.
IE 9 / 2 = 4.5 (remainder of 5)

If we use the modulo

this determines an even number.
10 % 2 = 0

this determines an odd number.
9 % 2 = 1
