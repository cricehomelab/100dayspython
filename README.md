# 100dayspython
This is my progress working through the 100 days of code python course on Udemy

Here is a link to the course I am working through:

Projects of note:

- BlackJack:
  https://github.com/cricehomelab/100dayspython/blob/main/D11_Capstone_Blackjack_v3.py
  This is a Blackjack app I was able to build on day 11 of this course. The idea was to build a basic textual app that simulates playing blackjack. You can read the sourcecode 
  here and can even play it on https://replit.com/@cricehomelab/BlackJack?v=1 
  This is the first of the "Capstone" projects for the course. There is a "solution" video for this, but my answer varies significantly from the instructor and I was able to add a 
  few extra features like a score tally to see how many games you win, lose or draw.
