# 100dayspython
This is my progress working through the 100 days of code python course on Udemy

Here is a link to the course I am working through:

I wanted to highlight some of the challenges I am particularly proud of. 

Text based applications:
- BlackJack:
  https://github.com/cricehomelab/100dayspython/blob/main/D11_Capstone_Blackjack_v3.py
  This is a Blackjack app I was able to build on day 11 of this course. The idea was to build a basic textual app that simulates playing blackjack. You can read the sourcecode 
  here and can even play it on https://replit.com/@cricehomelab/BlackJack?v=1 
  This is the first of the "Capstone" projects for the course. There is a "solution" video for this, but my answer varies significantly from the instructor and I was able to add a 
  few extra features like a score tally to see how many games you win, lose or draw. 
- Coffee Machine:
  https://github.com/cricehomelab/100dayspython/blob/main/D15_CoffeeMachine.py
  This is a simulated coffee machine that was a challenge to create on Day 15 of the course. The challenge was to think through what a coin operated coffee machine would  need to 
  do from taking user input on what type of coffee a user would want, to checking if the correct ingredients are in stock, to taking coins, refunding over payments, "making" the 
  coffee, and finally, updating its inventory. In this course we were given a list of requirements 
  (https://github.com/cricehomelab/100dayspython/blob/main/D15_Coffee_Machine_Program_Requirements.pdf), and were cut loose after that. I found this to be a good challenge to 
  create this from the requirements with very little in the way of hints. I put the finished product here https://replit.com/@cricehomelab/CoffeeMaker?v=1 for an easy way of 
  seeing the finished product. Later on Day 16 of the course this was refactored to an Object Oriented approach in the course. The methods and classes were pre-written our task
  was to tap into those classes to create objects and use the attributes of the classes to do the same thing we had done previously. The easiest way to post this was was with
