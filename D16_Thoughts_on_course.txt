I wanted to write down a few thoughts on what I have really liked from this course so far.

I really like how we spent 15 days getting comfortable  with very basic concepts
    - Loops and understanding when to use a certain type of loop.
        - When to use while loops.
        - When to use a for loop.
        - I like that there was no push for using some of the more complex for loops. I know they are important later,
        but just getting the basics of how they work and when to use both types has helped me feel more like I'm
        standing on solid ground, and has allowed me to search out some of the more complex ways on my own and approach
        them with a better understanding. For instance, I figured out how to use enumerate() from reading documentation
        when I thought there should be a way of counting through my loop without declaring a counting variable in some
        places.
    - if/else statements and how to use them in a basic sense.
        - this seems to be a lot of the bread and butter of coding, by specifying how to handle multiple different
        options and adding options later.
    - functions. I really like that we are learning these and how think about using them for different purposes the
    coffee machine project was very helpful for figuring out the different functions I need to implement just going
    off of the requirement sheet that was provided for the project. Most of the bullet points ended up being able to
    be implemented in their own function.
    - lists and dictionaries.
        - Dictionaries have always been a struggle for me, and I feel like the coffee machine project helped me
        understand these better.
        - Iteration through a list or dictionary has been a challenge for me in the past, but I think with the amount
        of repetition we have had with looping through lists or dictionaries I understand ways of doing this better.
    - I think this has built a solid foundation without abstracting things too much at any given time, but abstracting
    little by little to get us to the next step on the staircase.
    - Slowly releasing the amount of instruction
        - I like how day one is very hands-on step-by-step instruction compared to day 15 where it was more of a "here
        are some instructions go make something" situation. This allowed me get detailed instruction on new stuff, but
        let me have the reigns when I knew the concepts, and it was time to let me go and figure it out.

What I hope to see.
    - I would hope we continue to get the hand-holding for new concepts, but move more quickly into the "figure it out"
    spaces in order to make our own discoveries. I've always learned best when I have to beat my head against the wall
    especially in abstract thought. I remember being in school and taking math classes. I didn't have my best learning
    from instruction, although it was very important, I learned best when I had to read the text myself and look line
    by line at a solution and then have to apply it to a different problem with a similar solution path.
